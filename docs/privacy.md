## Privacy policy

### We don't collect any "personal data"

If information isn’t collected, it can’t be stolen, demanded, leaked or abused.
Protecting your personal data is the best way to safeguard your online privacy.

### What is "personal data" for us?

We consider any information about you or your behavior that can be traced back to you as personal data.
Our definition of personal data is based on the privacy laws and regulations of the EU, including the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
These are widely regarded as the strongest privacy protections in the world.
